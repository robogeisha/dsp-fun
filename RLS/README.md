# RLS Adaptive Equalizer

C implementation of a Recursive Least Squares (RLS) adaptive equalizer using complex input and desired signals.

## Description

The RLS adaptive equalizer aims to minimize the error between the desired and output signals by iteratively adjusting the filter weights. The provided code generates random complex input and desired data samples and demonstrates the RLS equalization process.
